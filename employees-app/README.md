## `Project Assignment`

- The assignment of this project was to create a website that displays a whole list of employees and their stories.
- I have devided the list of employees with pagination to improve website performance.
- Each employee photo is clickable related story information of that employee.
- It is also possible to switch the list of employees in either a [Grid View] or a [List View].
- I have also added 2 dropdowns that will allow us to filter the list of employees either by [Name] or [Office].
- It is also possible to search for a specific employee.

### `yarn start`

You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn run build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
